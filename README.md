Small Scale Solar Power Project in Kanyakheri, Rajasthan

The proposed project titled under UCR is “Small Scale Solar Power Project in Kanyakheri, Rajasthan”,
which is a grid connected Solar Power project located in Bhilwara district in the state of Rajasthan (India).
PP has the full ownership of the project activity. The project is an operational activity with continuous
reduction of GHG, currently being applied under “Universal Carbon Registry” (UCR).

The purpose of the proposed project activity is to generate electricity using a clean and renewable source
of energy i.e., solar radiation. This project has been promoted by M/s RSWM Ltd.
The proposed project activity of 1.80 MW DC is installation and operation of solar power plant as per
below mentioned details.

As per the ex-ante estimate, this project will generate approximately 3,153 MWh of electricity per
annum considering an average PLF of 20%. The Solar power projects has Poly Crystalline Silicon
Modules. The generation of power from solar photovoltaic is a clean technology as there is no fossil
fuel fired or no GHG gases are emitted during the process. Photovoltaic module consists of several
photovoltaic cells connected by circuits and sealed in an environmentally protective laminate, which
forms the fundamental building blocks of the complete PV generating unit. Several PV panels mounted
on a frame are termed as PV Array. Thus, project activity leads to reduce the GHG emissions as it
displaces power from fossil fuel-based electricity generation in the regional grid. 

The estimated annual average and the total CO2e emission reduction by the project activity is expected
to be 2,838 tCO2e, whereas actual emission reduction achieved during the first CoU period shall be
submitted as a part of first monitoring and verification.

Since the project activity generates electricity through solar energy, a clean renewable energy source
it will not cause any negative impact on the environment and thereby contributes to climate change
mitigation efforts.
